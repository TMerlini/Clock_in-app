    "questions": {
      "workingHours": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "What are the standard working hours in Portugal?",
          "answer": "According to Portuguese labor law (Código do Trabalho), full-time employment is legally defined as 40 hours per week, typically distributed as 8 hours per day over a five-day workweek. This standard applies across various industries, though specific sectors may have different arrangements through collective bargaining agreements."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is the maximum daily working time?",
          "answer": "The standard daily working time is 8 hours per day. With overtime, employees can work up to 10 hours per day (8 regular hours + 2 hours overtime maximum). However, the total overtime is subject to annual limits."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What is Working Time Exemption (Isenção de Horário)?",
          "answer": "The exemption from working hours (Article 218 of Código do Trabalho) provides greater flexibility in work schedule execution. It requires a written agreement between employee and employer. Workers with this exemption still maintain their rights to rest periods, weekly rest, mandatory holidays, and daily rest of at least 11 hours between working days."
        }
      },
      "overtime": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "How much overtime can I work?",
          "answer": "The maximum overtime is limited to 2 hours per day. Annual caps are: 150 hours for companies with 50+ employees, 175 hours for smaller companies, and up to 200 hours in exceptional cases (force majeure or specific collective agreements)."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How is overtime compensated?",
          "answer": "Overtime compensation rates:\n• First hour: 125% of regular rate\n• Additional hours: 137.5% of regular rate\n• Weekend/holiday overtime: 150% of regular rate\n\nEmployers must request overtime in advance, and employees can decline for extenuating circumstances."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "When can employers request overtime?",
          "answer": "Employers can only request overtime when there's a temporary increase in work or an indispensable need to prevent damage to the company. Overtime must be requested in advance, and employees have the right to decline for valid reasons."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What does 'Isenção' (Unpaid Extra Hours) mean in this app?",
          "answer": "In this app, 'Isenção' refers to hours worked between 8-10 hours per day that may not receive overtime compensation if you have a Working Time Exemption agreement (Isenção de Horário). Hours beyond 10 per day are tracked as 'Paid Overtime' as they typically require additional compensation. The app includes an annual Isenção limit (default: 200 hours/year) - once reached, additional hours are automatically classified as paid overwork to ensure compliance."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "How does the annual Isenção limit work?",
          "answer": "The app tracks Isenção hours per calendar year (January 1 - December 31). You can configure the annual limit in Settings (default: 200 hours/year). Once the annual limit is reached, any additional hours beyond 8 per day are automatically classified as paid overwork instead of Isenção. The Analytics page shows your annual usage (e.g., '150 / 200 hours (50 remaining)') to help you monitor your limit throughout the year."
        }
      },
      "breaksRestPeriods": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "What breaks am I entitled to during work?",
          "answer": "For working periods exceeding 5 hours, employees are entitled to a break of between 1 hour and 2 hours. This break cannot be taken at the beginning or end of the working period and is commonly used for lunch."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What is the minimum daily rest period?",
          "answer": "Employees are entitled to a minimum of 11 consecutive hours of rest between working days. This applies to all workers, including those with Working Time Exemption agreements."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What is the minimum weekly rest period?",
          "answer": "Employees are entitled to a minimum of 24 consecutive hours of rest per week, typically taken on Sunday. This weekly rest period should ideally be added to the daily rest period of the preceding or following day, resulting in approximately 35 consecutive hours of rest."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can I work during my lunch break?",
          "answer": "No. The mandatory break after 5 hours of work (typically lunch) must be taken and cannot be worked through. This is a legal requirement under Portuguese labor law to ensure employee wellbeing."
        }
      },
      "weekendWork": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "Can I be required to work on weekends?",
          "answer": "Weekend work (Saturday and Sunday) is generally subject to special rules and typically requires employee consent. It's compensated at 150% of the regular rate and should respect the weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How is weekend work compensated?",
          "answer": "Weekend and public holiday work is paid at 150% of the regular rate. Some collective agreements or company policies may also grant additional benefits such as compensatory time off or bonuses, which can be tracked in this app's Weekend Work settings."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What are my rights if I work on Sunday?",
          "answer": "If you work on Sunday (the typical weekly rest day), you should receive: overtime compensation at 150% rate, and an alternative rest day during the week to maintain your 24-hour weekly rest entitlement."

      },
      "usingThisApp": {

        },
        "q2": {

        },
        "q3": {

        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "Why does the app separate 'Regular', 'Isenção', and 'Overwork' hours?",
          "answer": "The app categorizes hours to align with Portuguese law:\n• Regular Hours (0-8h): Standard working time\n• Isenção/Unpaid Extra (8-10h): Hours that may not be compensated if you have Working Time Exemption\n• Paid Overwork (10h+): Hours typically requiring overtime compensation at higher rates\n\nThis helps you and your employer track compliance and proper compensation."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Should I track my lunch breaks in the app?",
          "answer": "Yes! Tracking lunch breaks ensures compliance with the legal requirement for breaks after 5 hours of work. The app allows you to:\n• Mark when you took a lunch break\n• Record the duration (1-2 hours as per law)\n• Calculate actual working hours excluding breaks\n• Track lunch expenses if applicable"
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "How can I use the overwork tracking feature?",
          "answer": "The overwork tracking helps you monitor accumulated overtime:\n• View total overtime hours (converted to work days: 8h = 1 day)\n• Track when overtime is used/compensated\n• Ensure you don't exceed annual limits (150-200h)\n• Record reasons for overtime usage\n• Maintain compliance documentation"
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "How do I change the app language?",
          "answer": "The app supports Portuguese and English:\n• Go to Settings page\n• Navigate to the 'Language' section\n• Select your preferred language (Português or English)\n• The interface updates immediately\n• Your language preference is saved and persists across devices\n• Calendar dates and formatting automatically adapt to the selected language\n\nNote: The app defaults to Portuguese (pt) as the primary language."
        }

      "legalCompliance": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "Are employers required to track working hours?",
          "answer": "Yes. Employers in Portugal have a legal obligation to maintain accurate records of employees' working hours.

        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What should I do if I regularly exceed overtime limits?",
          "answer": "If you regularly exceed the legal overtime limits (2h/day or 150-200h/year), you should:\n1. Document your hours (use this app for records)\n2.
