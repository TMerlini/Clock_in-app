  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Clock In - Intelligent Time Manager | Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using Clock In ("the app", "we", "our"), you agree to these Terms of Service and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Clock In is a time tracking application that helps you record work sessions, calculate earnings, track compliance with Portuguese labor law, and optionally sync with Google Calendar. The app is provided "as is" for personal and professional use.</p>

  <h2>3. Account and Use</h2>
  <p>You must sign in with a valid Google account to use Clock In. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activity under your account. You agree to provide accurate information and to use the app only for lawful purposes.</p>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to misuse the app, including: attempting to access other users' data; reverse-engineering or circumventing security; using the app for illegal activities; or violating any applicable laws or third-party rights. We may suspend or terminate access for violations.</p>

  <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Paid plans (Basic, Pro, Premium AI, Enterprise) are billed according to the pricing displayed in the app. Payments are processed by Stripe. Refunds and cancellations are handled per Stripe's terms and our subscription policies. Free trials may apply; you will be charged if you do not cancel before the trial ends.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Clock In and its content, features, and functionality are owned by us. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the app or its parts without permission.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The app is provided for informational and organizational purposes. Time tracking, finance calculations, and AI advice (including Portuguese labor law guidance) are not legal, tax, or professional advice. You should consult qualified professionals for formal advice.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the app in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these terms or for operational reasons. Upon termination, your right to use the app ceases; provisions that by nature should survive (e.g. disclaimers, limitation of liability) will remain in effect.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date will reflect changes. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Material changes may be communicated via the app or email.</p>

  <h2>11. Related Policies</h2>
